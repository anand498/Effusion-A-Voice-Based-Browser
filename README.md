# Effusion-Voice Based Browser
This application is in development period. So errors and bugs are bound to occur on certain instances.
This application is built purely on C Sharp(C#).

**NOTE- This voice recognition only works on the mic of the computer and not on the mic of the 
audio device attached to it. For eg: Earphones and Headsets.**
How does it work?
Voiced based grammar of the broswer:
" Search 'string' " --> Will perform google search for the string
" Open , goto 'string' " --> Will open the website (Will add a .com after the string):
For an instance:
To open a new tab command should be "New Tab".
To close a tab command should be "Close Tab".
To open google.com command should be "goo-gle".
